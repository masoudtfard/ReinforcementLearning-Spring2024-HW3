# Reinforcement Learning - HW3 - Spring 2024
## Sharif University of Technology
### Policy Gradient Methods, REINFORCE algorithm, PPO

This repository contains my solutions for the 3rd assignment of the Reinforcement Learning course (CE957) at Sharif University of Technology. This assignment consists of two parts: theoretical and practical.

#### Theoretical Part

- **RL Objective**: Discusses properties of Reinforcement Learning objective function.
- **Bias & Variance of Policy Gradient**
- **Trust Region Policy Optimization**
- **Deterministic Policy Gradient**

#### Practical Part

- **RL_PHW3_MasoudTahmasbi_402200275.ipynb**: This Jupyter notebook contains the implementation of the REINFORCE and Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) algorithms in the [CartPole-v1](https://gymnasium.farama.org/environments/classic_control/cart_pole/) environment.
